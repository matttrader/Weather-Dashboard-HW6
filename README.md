# homework-6
The purpose of the homework six project was to create a Weather Dashboard that would provide a look ahead to the weather in a city location that you may be traveling to in the near future.  The weather dashboard was to have a city search box and then ideally provide a real-time, five-day upcoming forecast. 

The purpose of this scheduler application project was to combine and deploy the concepts and skills of html, CSS and JavaScript recently introduced.   

This weather dashboard utilizes the use of a data API in comjunction with an html file, a JavaScript source link and a CSS stylesheet link.

Below is a screenshot of the "Super Accurate Weather Dashboard" application.
